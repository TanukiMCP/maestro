### Example Usage

```python
from mcp.client import MCPClient

# Connect to the server
client = MCPClient("maestro-mcp")

# Orchestrate a task
result = await client.tools.orchestrate_task(
    task_description="Analyze customer feedback data",
    complexity_level="moderate"
)

# Discover analysis engines
engines = await client.tools.discover_analysis_engines(
    task_type="data_analysis",
    domain_context="customer_feedback"
)

# Run analysis
result = await client.tools.run_analysis(
    engine_domain="nlp",
    computation_type="sentiment_analysis",
    parameters={"text": "Great product!"}
)
```
