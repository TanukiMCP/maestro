# Maestro MCP Server: Architecture

## High-Level Overview

Maestro MCP Server is a modular, extensible platform for orchestrating complex, multi-agent workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed for backend, headless operation and can be deployed via HTTP, stdio, or Docker.

## Core Components

- **FastMCP Server**: Handles all MCP protocol logic, HTTP/stdio transport, and tool registration
- **Tool Registry**: All tools are registered and discoverable instantly
- **Orchestration Engine**: Generates, plans, and executes multi-phase workflows
- **Intelligence Amplification Engines (IAE)**: Specialized engines for advanced reasoning, computation, and analysis
- **Error Handling**: Structured error analysis and recovery
- **Collaboration Framework**: Supports user-in-the-loop and agent collaboration

## Extensibility

- Add new tools in `src/maestro/tools.py` or as plugins
- Register new engines in `src/engines/`
- Extend orchestration logic in `src/maestro/orchestration_framework.py`

## Agent Model

Maestro supports multi-agent collaboration, with agent profiles for research, domain expertise, validation, synthesis, and context. Each agent can invoke tools, analyze results, and contribute to the workflow.

## Deployment

- **Smithery.ai**: Containerized, instant tool discovery, health checks
- **Docker**: Production-ready container
- **Local**: Python/Uvicorn for development
