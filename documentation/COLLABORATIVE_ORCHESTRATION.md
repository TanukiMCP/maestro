# 🤝 Collaborative Orchestration Framework

## Overview

The TanukiMCP Maestro now includes an advanced **Collaborative Fallback System** that intelligently detects when user collaboration is needed during workflow execution and provides standardized interaction patterns for seamless human-AI collaboration.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Collaboration Detection
- **Ambiguity Assessment**: Automatically detects unclear or ambiguous task requirements
- **Context Completeness Analysis**: Identifies when insufficient context is provided
- **Requirement Conflict Detection**: Spots conflicting or contradictory requirements
- **Scope Clarity Evaluation**: Assesses whether task boundaries are well-defined

### 🗺️ Standardized Workflow Framework
- **Workflow Nodes**: Start, execution, validation, collaboration, and end nodes
- **Validation Criteria**: Standardized success criteria with automated and manual checks
- **Collaboration Points**: Predefined points where user input may be required
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when collaboration is unavailable

### 🔄 Multi-Stage Validation
- **Pre-execution**: Validate requirements before starting
- **Mid-execution**: Check progress and quality during execution
- **Post-execution**: Verify results after completion
- **Final validation**: Comprehensive quality assurance

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Collaboration Detection Engine
```python
class CollaborationMode(Enum):
    CONTEXT_CLARIFICATION = "context_clarification"
    SCOPE_DEFINITION = "scope_definition"
    AMBIGUITY_RESOLUTION = "ambiguity_resolution"
    REQUIREMENTS_REFINEMENT = "requirements_refinement"
    VALIDATION_CONFIRMATION = "validation_confirmation"
    PROGRESS_REVIEW = "progress_review"
```

#### 2. Workflow Orchestration
```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowNode:
    node_id: str
    node_type: str  # "start", "execution", "validation", "collaboration", "end"
    workflow_step: Optional[WorkflowStep]

```

## Usage

### 1. Enable Collaborative Fallback

```python
# Enable collaboration fallback (default: True)
result = await maestro_orchestrate(
    task_description="Complex analysis task",
    enable_collaboration_fallback=True,
    validation_rigor="thorough"  # Enables workflow framework
)
```

### 2. Handle Collaboration Requests

When collaboration is needed, you'll receive a structured request:

```markdown
# 🤝 User Collaboration Required

## Collaboration Request ID: collab_20250103_143022

### Why Collaboration is Needed
**Trigger:** Detected: high_ambiguity, insufficient_context
**Mode:** Context Clarification
**Urgency:** medium
**Estimated Resolution Time:** 5-10 minutes

### Questions for You
1. Could you clarify the specific scope of analysis required?
2. What are the key success criteria for this task?
3. Are there any constraints or limitations to consider?

### Available Options
- **Option A**: Proceed with general analysis
- **Option B**: Focus on specific domain expertise
- **Option C**: Request additional research

### Required Context
- task_clarification
- success_criteria_definition
- scope_boundaries
```

### 3. Respond to Collaboration Requests

```python
# Respond to collaboration request
response = await maestro_collaboration_response(
    collaboration_id="collab_20250103_143022",
    responses={
        "scope": "Focus on financial risk analysis for Q4 2024",
        "success_criteria": "Identify top 5 risk factors with mitigation strategies",
        "constraints": "Use only publicly available data"
    },
    additional_context={
        "domain": "financial_analysis",
        "time_period": "Q4_2024",
        "data_sources": ["public_filings", "market_data"]
    },
    approval_status="approved",
    confidence_level=0.9
)
```

## Workflow Execution Flow

### Standard Workflow Nodes

1. **Start Node**
   - Initial scope validation
   - Context completeness check
   - Collaboration trigger assessment

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Task decomposition
   - Domain expertise validation
   - Resource requirement analysis

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Solution execution
   - Mid-execution validation
   - Progress monitoring

4. **Final Validation**
   - Quality assurance
   - Completeness verification
   - User approval (if required)

5. **End Node**
   - Results compilation
   - Audit trail generation

### Collaboration Triggers

The system automatically triggers collaboration when:

- **Ambiguity Score > 0.7**: Task description is unclear
- **Context Completeness < 0.6**: Insufficient information provided
- **Requirement Conflicts**: Contradictory requirements detected
- **Scope Clarity < 0.7**: Task boundaries are unclear
- **Validation Failures**: Quality thresholds not met
- **Execution Errors**: Unexpected complexity encountered

## Validation Framework

### Built-in Validation Templates

#### Accuracy Check
- **Method**: Tool-based validation
- **Tools**: `maestro_iae`, `fact_checker`
- **Threshold**: 0.85
- **Evidence**: Source verification, calculation proof

#### Completeness Check
- **Method**: Rule-based validation
- **Threshold**: 0.9
- **Evidence**: Requirement mapping, coverage analysis
- **Manual Review**: Required

#### Quality Assurance
- **Method**: LLM-based validation
- **Tools**: `maestro_orchestrate`, `quality_evaluator`
- **Threshold**: 0.85
- **Evidence**: Quality metrics, peer review

### Custom Validation Criteria

You can define custom validation criteria:

```python
custom_criteria = ValidationCriteria(
    criteria_id="domain_expertise_check",
    description="Verify domain-specific accuracy",
    validation_method="external_api",
    success_threshold=0.9,
    validation_tools=["domain_expert_api"],
    fallback_methods=["manual_expert_review"],
    required_evidence=["expert_validation_report"],
    automated_checks=[
        {"type": "domain_accuracy", "threshold": 0.9},
        {"type": "terminology_check", "threshold": 0.85}
    ],
    manual_review_needed=True
)
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Seamless Tool Integration

The collaborative framework integrates with all existing Maestro tools:

- **maestro_search**: Enhanced with collaboration-aware research
- **maestro_scrape**: Validates data extraction requirements
- **maestro_iae**: Incorporates user feedback into analysis
- **maestro_execute**: Confirms execution parameters
- **maestro_error_handler**: Collaborative error resolution

### Backward Compatibility

All existing orchestration calls continue to work:

```python
# Traditional orchestration (still works)
result = await maestro_orchestrate(
    task_description="Simple task",
    enable_collaboration_fallback=False  # Disable collaboration
)

# Enhanced orchestration with collaboration
result = await maestro_orchestrate(
    task_description="Complex task",
    validation_rigor="rigorous",  # Enables full workflow
    enable_collaboration_fallback=True
)
```

## Configuration Options

### Validation Rigor Levels

- **basic**: Minimal validation, no workflow framework
- **standard**: Standard validation with basic checks
- **thorough**: Enhanced validation with workflow framework
- **rigorous**: Full validation with mandatory collaboration points

### Collaboration Settings

```python
# Fine-tune collaboration behavior
result = await maestro_orchestrate(
    task_description="Task requiring collaboration",
    enable_collaboration_fallback=True,
    validation_rigor="thorough",
    context={
        "require_final_approval": True,  # Force final approval
        "collaboration_threshold": 0.8,  # Higher threshold for triggering
        "auto_approve_low_risk": False   # Disable auto-approval
    }
)
```
