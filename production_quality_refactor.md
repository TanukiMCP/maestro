# Maestro MCP Server Production Quality Refactor Plan

**IMPORTANT: All Maestro MCP server tools must be IDE-agnostic, headless, and must NOT implement their own LLM client, UI, or agentic frontend. They are to be called by external agentic IDEs (e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cline) or LLM clients. All orchestration, tool selection, and execution must be backend-only, composable, and strictly agentic. No duplication of LLM client logic or UI is permitted.**

This document outlines the 8 phases required to bring each Maestro Model Context Protocol (MCP) server tool to true production quality. Each phase details the current status, the definition of "production quality" for that tool, and the exact steps needed to achieve it. The goal: **zero placeholders, fully agentic, dynamic, and LLM-usable tools that reflect the true intent of MCP.**

## ✅ Phase 1: maestro_orchestrate

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Returns real orchestration results with multi-step planning
- ✅ Performs real multi-step orchestration and tool chaining
- ✅ No internal LLM client or UI logic
- ✅ Backend-only, composable, and IDE-agnostic

**Production Quality Definition:**
- ✅ Accepts a real task description, context, and criteria from an external LLM/agent/IDE (not from its own client).
- ✅ Dynamically plans, coordinates, and executes multi-step workflows using other available tools.
- ✅ Returns a structured, real orchestration result (plan, execution trace, outputs, errors, etc.).
- ✅ No hardcoded or simulated responses.
- ✅ **Must be headless, composable, and backend-only. No UI, LLM client, or agentic frontend logic.**

**Steps Achieved:**
1. ✅ Implemented a real orchestration engine that can:
   - Parse the task, context, and criteria (all provided by the external caller, not an internal client).
   - Plan a sequence of tool calls (using available tools from a dynamic registry).
   - Execute each step, passing outputs as needed.
   - Aggregate and return the full execution trace and results.
2. ✅ Removed all placeholder/mock logic.
3. ✅ Removed any UI, LLM client, or agentic frontend code.
4. ✅ Added error handling, logging, and traceability for each orchestration run.
5. ✅ Tested with real multi-step agentic tasks, called from external IDEs/clients.

- ✅ Uses real logic (e.g., keyword matching, capability analysis, or LLM-based reasoning) to recommend the best tool(s).
- ✅ Returns a structured, dynamic recommendation with reasoning.
- ✅ **No UI, LLM client, or agentic frontend logic. Must be backend-only.**

**Steps Achieved:**
1. ✅ Integrated with the dynamic tool registry.
2. ✅ Implemented real selection logic (rule-based, LLM-based, or hybrid).
3. ✅ Added recommendations with confidence scores and reasoning.
4. ✅ Removed all static or placeholder responses.
5. ✅ Tested with a variety of request types and tool sets from external callers.

## ✅ Phase 4: maestro_iae

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Returns real computation results
- ✅ Performs real mathematical, statistical, and analytical computation
- ✅ Backend-only, no UI or LLM client logic

**Production Quality Definition:**
- ✅ Accepts real computation requests from the LLM/agent/IDE.
- ✅ Dispatches to actual computation engines (e.g., NumPy, SymPy, Pandas, custom engines).
- ✅ Returns real computed results, errors, and trace info.
- ✅ Supports multiple engine types and precision levels.
- ✅ **No UI, LLM client, or agentic frontend logic. Must be backend-only.**

**Steps Achieved:**
1. ✅ Integrated with real computation libraries and engines.
2. ✅ Implemented dispatch logic based on engine_type and precision_level.
3. ✅ Added structured results (values, errors, trace).
4. ✅ Removed all simulated or static outputs.
5. ✅ Tested with a range of computation requests from external callers.

## ✅ Phase 5: maestro_search

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Returns real HTML/text/metadata from web searches
- ✅ Supports multiple search engines with dynamic selection
- ✅ Backend-only, no UI or LLM client logic

**Production Quality Definition:**
- ✅ Accepts any query or URL, supports multiple search engines (all free, no API key required).
- ✅ Returns the real, full HTML, visible text, and metadata for the page.
- ✅ Optionally supports screenshots, cookies, and browser automation.
- ✅ No manual parsing or static summaries.
- ✅ **No UI, LLM client, or agentic frontend logic. Must be backend-only.**
